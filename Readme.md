===========

This is the main repository for team USP-Brasil @ iGEM 2015. We are
sharing here a supplementary material we have developed to help us
with modeling and data analysis. You can find below some quick links,
but feel free to [visit our
wiki](https://github.com/thmosqueiro/modeligem/wiki) to find more
material and a comprehensive guide throughout our repository!
